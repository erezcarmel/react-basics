# React basics
## Session #1

### Create the following components:

`TodoApp` - The React app base, using the `TodoList` component

`TodoList` - List of `Todo` components, using the `todos.json` content. Show list only when list was loaded and available in teh component's state.

`Todo` - List item, showing the item `text`

--- 
_Remember using:_
- React hooks:
  - [x] useState
  - [x] useEffect
  - [x] Inline scripting (Array's map/forEach)

#### Don't forget to run `yarn install` before coding!
